## 🗓️ Sprint 1

### What I did
- During this sprint I added all assets needed for the project and began importing aniamtions


### Difficulties
- Some of the sprites didn't fully work as we wanted (not the animations we wanted or the free version didn't include the specifc sprites we wanted) so we decided to buy some new player sprites. and ice spice

### Surprises
- The sprites we bought didn't have just normal left and right animations but we found a fine work around by using the down left animations.

### Lessons Learned
- I learned that I should look more into the sprites we use to make sure their exactly what we want.



## 🗓️ Sprint 2

### Difficulties
- This sprint I heavily focused on movement animations and struggled sometimes with making the animation change based on the directrion the player was facing. Throughout this sprint I went ahead and added almost all of the animations we'll need to the animated sprite 2D and also named them all properly based on direction player and action.

### Surprises
- I was supprised about how I was able to really get going on code and focus.

### Lessons Learned
- I learned in this sprint how player animations may be a long task then I originally thought but I was also really happy with the sprites we used.
