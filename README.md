 [Gun Runner]
ðŸ“– Project Description:
The main character is an explorer who stumbled upon a tunnel that leads him into an underground sewage system that runs underground. The explorer will have to explore each room to find the Abyss King which guards the door to escape the underground. The game will have a dark aesthetic to it. Each room will have gross looking enemies that need to be killed to progress to the next room. The explorer will have to use his weapons to clear each room and the Abyss King in order to escape. The main source of inspiration for the game is Enter the Gungeon.
