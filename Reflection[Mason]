# Reflection - [Mason]

## 🗓️ Sprint 1

### What I did
-I wrote the code for the dash ability in the player script.

### Difficulties
-I found out that I suck at actually figuring out which nodes I need to use to make things work properly, but I got it. Jamion was also a major difficulty during this sprint and all that come after it.

### Surprises
-The sprites we were going to use for the player ended up being too low quality. The new sprites we purchased has unusual animations, but we found a workaround to make them work.

### Lessons Learned
-Things are a lot easier than they seem sometimes.



## 🗓️ Sprint 2

### What I did
- During this sprint I focused on helping Ty with the player script and helping the rest of the team when needed

### Difficulties
- Ty had issues with the player script that I couldn't understand enough to help with, and Jamion(Ice Spice) was enough of a distraction to prevent me from making meaningful progress on my own tasks. Brayden was tasked with working on the UI, but at this point he hadn't done anything with it.

### Surprises
- There were no major surprises, but I was surprised at how much work was being put into the player movement script.

### Lessons Learned
- I learned that Brayden was probably not going to be doing any real work, but I had some faith.
