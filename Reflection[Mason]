# Reflection - [Mason]

## üóìÔ∏è Sprint 1

### What I did
-I wrote the code for the dash ability in the player script.

### Difficulties
-I found out that I suck at actually figuring out which nodes I need to use to make things work properly, but I got it. Jamion was also a major difficulty during this sprint and all that come after it.

### Surprises
-The sprites we were going to use for the player ended up being too low quality. The new sprites we purchased has unusual animations, but we found a workaround to make them work.

### Lessons Learned
-Things are a lot easier than they seem sometimes.



## üóìÔ∏è Sprint 2

### What I did
- During this sprint I focused on helping Ty with the player script and helping the rest of the team when needed

### Difficulties
- Ty had issues with the player script that I couldn't understand enough to help with, and Jamion(Ice Spice) was enough of a distraction to prevent me from making meaningful progress on my own tasks. Brayden was tasked with working on the UI, but at this point he hadn't done anything with it.

### Surprises
- There were no major surprises, but I was surprised at how much work was being put into the player movement script.

### Lessons Learned
- I learned that Brayden was probably not going to be doing any real work, but I had some faith.


## üóìÔ∏è Sprint 3

### What I did
- I started working on the Ui for the game since Brayden quit.

### Difficulties
- I found that I have literally no clue how to do the UI and I overthought the process. This caused me to halt progress and fumble learning the steps to make the UI work.
- Jamion. Need I say more?

### Surprises
- I found that the progress on Blake's work was going particularly well and he is more skilled than I had thought.

### Lessons Learned
- In Blake we trust. In Brayden we do not.


## üóìÔ∏è Sprint 4

### Difficulties
- I found that I was still having issues with finishing the UI and understanding how to use custom signals. I was helping the rest of the team or being distracted by none other than Ice Spice himself too often to actually make proper progress.

### Surprises
- When I got help with the UI, I found that a lot of the things I was trying to do were far more simple than I had thought. I just needed some time to actually focus on them.

### Lessons Learned
- I need to find a way to ignore my surroundings when I work or I won't be successful whatsoever.


## üóìÔ∏è Sprint 5

### Difficulties
- Juma submitted his maps and they were completely unusable. I knew they wouldn't be perfect, but I had some faith in him and it was clear at this point that no amount of faith could save these levels.
- Now I need to remake all of the levels or at least enough to be usable, I need to finish the UI and controls, I need to make finishing touches to the game, I need to make proper level teleport code, I need to find a way to get a score system, and a few other things.

### Surprises
- I found that when I don't have Ice Spice to distract me, I can work and get a lot of things done. Sitting next to him is my bane.

### Lessons Learned
- Don't ever sit next to Jamion, whether it be voluntarily or non-voluntarily, and find any way possible to get proper work done as often as possible in the future.
